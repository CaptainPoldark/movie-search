## Description

This project uses the OMDb API to search for movies and TV shows
It returns and displays the poster, title, type (movie, series), link to IMDB, and the release date

## Features

The link text for IMDB reflects whether the result is a movie or TV series
Dark mode and light mode styling is automatically set depending on the browser settings (I prefer the Dark Mode personally)

## Roadmap

Add plot summary to results, search by production company, actor, or specific title, add trailer.
